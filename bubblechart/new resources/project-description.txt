Bubble Chart of Finance Data in D3.js

We are looking for an expert in data visualization with D3.js to help us
refine and implement a bubble chart/scatter plot which describes the price of
an underlying and the trade volume of options on the underlying at various
strike prices over time.  The goal is to make it easy for anyone viewing the
chart to visualize the price volatility of the underlying and market activity
on the options related to that volatility.

This project is to write a JavaScript function, and any dependencies of that
function, which will take all required data and configuration options as input
and generate a line chart using D3.js (and, optionally, NVD3.js).  The
deliverable will be the JavaScript function, any dependency code on which it
relies, and any CSS rules to define the visual style of the chart.

Broadly, the line chart will consist of a primary curve and multiple overlayed
secondary curves with differing Y-axes and several labels and marks to convey
additional information through the chart.

We have a detailed specification of our current design for the chart available
to share with potential applicants.
